# Self-Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

It was a little difficult as I got caught on some things. For example, I got caught on how to write a code that would feed the dragon, and change the is_hungry attribute to "false" once it had been called 4 times.

I paused for a pair programming exercise, which included the celebrate_birthday method, and realized I could use what I learned from that to solve my problem with the dragon!

I learned that moving on to a different problem may help me with a previous problem, so it's okay to skip things or work out of order. I may find a solution to problem 2 once I hit problem 7!

It felt good to work hard on something and finally figure it out. The adventure to discovery was also entertaining.

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

I originally planned to take breaks every 25 minutes per my pomodoro timer. But what has ended up happening instead is that once that timer goes off, I'm usually very invested in what I'm working on and would rather keep going than take a break.

However, whenever a timer or notification goes off while I'm *not* feeling great, it forces me to check the time and check in with myself. Then I take a break and come back. I think having a loud notification every once in a while to force me to pause and check the time and determine whether I need a break will be effective for me.

- What did you learn from this exercise that you want to remember as you begin Mod 1?

That it's okay to move on and work on something else and come back later!!!! Doing something else is still productive, and I might learn the solution I need by stepping away!
